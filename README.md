# Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 questions. See other repository branches for solutions from other years.

Run the `main.py` script for a given day to run the solution code for that day:

```shell
python src/1/main.py
```

Run the `pytest` command to run solution code tests against sample data for that day:

```shell
pytest src/1/  # Runs tests for day one
pytest         # Runs all tests
```
